  <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
  # About The Project
  team-profile-generator utilises inquirer to prompt the user for information regarding employees within a company. The user can select from Manager, Engineers or Interns, and add information like email, github usernames, company id numbers and others. The application will then collate this information into an easily readable format and render them in a stylish html document ready for viewing. Live links for github profiles will be created, as well as links for emails that will open the users default email application.
